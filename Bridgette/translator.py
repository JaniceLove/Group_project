##Translate nucelotides to amino acid sequence

#load packages

#load map
map = open("codonmap.txt", "r")

#load nucleotide sequence to translate as read only

#create document as write only to save results to


#define start of sequence
    #variable1 = some kind of search function looking for "ATG'

#define end of sequence
    #variable2 = some kind of search function looking for 'TAA' in variable1
    
#CDS = sequence between variable 1 and variable 2 points

#****Or use for loop nested in while loop that exits when 'TAA' is next to replace****

#for loop for 3 nucleotide letters in CDS
    #replace with amino acid letter
    #append to document
    #go to next 3 letters
