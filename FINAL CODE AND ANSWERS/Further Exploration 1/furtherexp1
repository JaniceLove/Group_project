Megablast: fast, highly similar and larger sequences. Works best with over 95% matches.
"word size"=28 base pairs
most "100%" matches
most same-species matches

discontiguous megablast: more dissimilar than megablast, more sensitive than
than blastn. Allows for mismatches, intended for cross-species comparisons.
"word size"=11 or 12 bp
least "100%" matches
most cross-species matches

blastn: somewhat similar sequences, find more distantly related sequences,
slowest. Best for matching short sequences.
"word size"=7-11 bp
moderate number of "100%" matches
more cross-species matches than megablast
