*We all plan on working on all portions of the project together and editing each other's code as we go
to obtain the most efficient version of code for the final project version.

1) Identify the genes
-> Blast the sequences
-> download the results files
-> format results files in UNIX to select best gene cadidates

2) Obtain amino acid sequence of selected candidates
-> Search protein database for aa sequence from top hits
-> Download 10-20 aa sequences

3) Turn our sequences into aa sequences
-> Use python to write script that translates cDNA into aa

4) Compare aa sequences from RNAseq and protein database
-> Use muscle to align sequences
-> Use hmmbuild to make HMM files
-> Use hmm search to analyze similarities of aa sequences

5) Visualize results
-> Graph expression profiles
-> Compare results to literature
