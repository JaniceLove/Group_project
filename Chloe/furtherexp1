Megablast: fast, highly similar sequences. Works best with over 95% matches.
"word size"=28 base pairs

discontiguous megablast: more dissimilar than megablast, more sensitive than
than blastn. Allows for mismatches, intended for cross-species comparisons.
"word size"=11 or 12 bp

blastn: somewhat similar sequences, find more distantly related sequences,
slowest.
"word size"=7-11 bp
