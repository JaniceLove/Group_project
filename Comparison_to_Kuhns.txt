Study done by Kuhns and Pluznick (2017) found the following transcriptional changes:

Ptpn5: upregulated
Synpr: upregulated
Slc7a12: downregulated
Gsta2: downregulated 
Lhx2: upregulated
Atp12a: upregulated 

In our RNA-seq data we found:

Ptpn5: N/A
Synpr: upregulated
Slc7a12: unchanged
Gsta2: downregulated 
Lhx2: N/A
Atp12a: upregulated
